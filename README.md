# Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence algorithms designed to perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are built on deep learning techniques and trained on massive datasets, enabling them to understand, generate, and predict human-like text. The term "large" refers to the vast number of parameters these models possess—often in the billions—making them capable of handling complex linguistic tasks with remarkable accuracy.

## How LLMs Work

LLMs primarily use **transformer architectures**, which consist of encoders and decoders with self-attention mechanisms. 

1. **Training**
2. **Fine-Tuning**
3. **Inference**

## Applications of LLMs

### 1. **Content Generation**
- Examples: GPT-4, Claude AI.

### 2. **Language Translation and Localization**

### 3. **Search Engines**

### 5. **Code Generation**
